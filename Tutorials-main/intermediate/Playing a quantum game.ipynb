    "Quantum games work in a similar way like games that involve an element of probability. Consider a game where different players have to beat a house or referee. The players are not allowed to communicate with each other during the duration of the game and have to prepare a strategy in advance. To win, the outputs or results given by the players have to satisfy a certain condition or rule of the game. In this tutorial, we will build and play a quantum game by exploring different classical and quantum game strategies!"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " Similar to classical computation, quantum computation can be performed using the circuit model of computation, applying different logic gates . Qubits are the analogues of bits and quantum gates   operate on qubits, whilst manipulating quantum mechanical properties . What makes a quantum gate special is its reversibility. In order to have reversible quantum gates, we need to implement it using unitary operations; operations which preserve the sum of the probabilities of seeing each measurable value of the qubits. The sum of the probabilities of each outcome must add up to 1."

    "### **Qubits**\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computation the objects of the computation are quantum objects called qubits. Qubits are represented as |0⟩ and |1⟩. The qubit state |Ψ⟩ can be expressed as a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩, or |Ψ⟩=a|0⟩+b|1⟩ where a and b are complex numbers, proportional to measuring the probability of its corresponding outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the probability of measuring the qubit state as |0⟩ is $a^2$ and |1⟩ is given by $|b|^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "respectively. Another interesting property that we must know of  is entanglement, which Einstein described as \"spooky action at a distance\". If two qubits are entangled with each other, then if we know the value taken by one of them, then without even observing the second qubit we know it's state/value. The correlations between the values of entangled qubits is unique to quantum probabilities and something we cannot perform on a classical computer. In fact, it is not possible to separate an entangled system in to its independent parts. Whenever we want to observe the value of a quantum system, we must make a measurement of their state. This, causes the system to take collapse to one value. It is not possible to determine with certainty which value the system will take, but we can think about the various probabilities for the allowed values."

If the control qubit is in the state |0⟩, then no operation is performed on the target qubit. However, if the control qubit is in the state |1⟩, then a X gate is performed on the target qubit.

They can manipulate their own input however they wish, according to their strategy, and then choose a bit to output. Alice will output a bit **a** and Bob a bit **b**\n",
